# Multitrack Recorder for Behringer X32

This project is still in development so may not work as expected.  
Inspired by https://github.com/jajito/X32-Recorder/tree/main

**Multitrack-Recorder-Behringer-X32** is a Python-based wrapper around FFmpeg for Linux.  
It allows recording and playback of 16-channel audio from a Behringer X32 (or any other console acting as a multichannel audio interface) with a simple **Web UI** by Flask.

This project was primarily created to enable devices like **Odroid** or **Raspberry Pi** to stay connected to a X32 console, record live shows, or play multitrack `.wav` files for virtual soundcheck.
